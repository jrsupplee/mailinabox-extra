# Postfix (SMTP)
# --------------
#
# Postfix handles the transmission of email between servers
# using the SMTP protocol. It is a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
#
# Postfix listens on port 25 (SMTP) for incoming mail from
# other servers on the Internet. It is responsible for very
# basic email filtering such as by IP address and greylisting,
# it checks that the destination address is valid, rewrites
# destinations according to aliases, and passses email on to
# another service for local mail delivery.
#
# The first hop in local mail delivery is to Spamassassin via
# LMTP. Spamassassin then passes mail over to Dovecot for
# storage in the user's mailbox.
#
# Postfix also listens on port 587 (SMTP+STARTLS) for
# connections from users who can authenticate and then sends
# their email out to the outside world. Postfix queries Dovecot
# to authenticate users.
#
# Address validation, alias rewriting, and user authentication
# is configured in a separate setup script mail-users.sh
# because of the overlap of this part with the Dovecot
# configuration.

source setup/functions.sh # load our functions
source /etc/mailinabox.conf # load global vars

# ### Install packages.

# Install postfix's packages.
#
# * `postfix`: The SMTP server.
# * `postfix-pcre`: Enables header filtering.
# * `postgrey`: A mail policy service that soft-rejects mail the first time
#   it is received. Spammers don't usually try agian. Legitimate mail
#   always will.
# * `ca-certificates`: A trust store used to squelch postfix warnings about
#   untrusted opportunistically-encrypted connections.

# ### Basic Settings

# Set some basic settings...
#
# * Have postfix listen on all network interfaces.
# * Make outgoing connections on a particular interface (if multihomed) so that SPF passes on the receiving side.
# * Set our name (the Debian default seems to be "localhost" but make it our hostname).
# * Set the name of the local machine to localhost, which means xxx@localhost is delivered locally, although we don't use it.
# * Set the SMTP banner (which must have the hostname first, then anything).

	smtpd_banner="\$myhostname ESMTP Hi, I'm a Mail-in-a-Box (Ubuntu/Postfix; see https://mailinabox.email/)" \
	mydestination=localhost

# Tweak some queue settings:
# * Inform users when their e-mail delivery is delayed more than 3 hours (default is not to warn).
# * Stop trying to send an undeliverable e-mail after 2 days (instead of 5), and for bounce messages just try for 1 day.

# ### Outgoing Mail

# Enable the 'submission' port 587 smtpd server and tweak its settings.
#
# * Enable authentication. It's disabled globally so that it is disabled on port 25,
#   so we need to explicitly enable it here.
# * Do not add the OpenDMAC Authentication-Results header. That should only be added
#   on incoming mail. Omit the OpenDMARC milter by re-setting smtpd_milters to the
#   OpenDKIM milter only. See dkim.sh.
# * Even though we dont allow auth over non-TLS connections (smtpd_tls_auth_only below, and without auth the client cant
#   send outbound mail), don't allow non-TLS mail submission on this port anyway to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
# * Require the best ciphers for incoming connections per http://baldric.net/2013/12/07/tls-ciphers-in-postfix-and-dovecot/.
#   By putting this setting here we leave opportunistic TLS on incoming mail at default cipher settings (any cipher is better than none).
# * Give it a different name in syslog to distinguish it from the port 25 smtpd server.
# * Add a new cleanup service specific to the submission service ('authclean')
#   that filters out privacy-sensitive headers on mail being sent out by
#   authenticated users.  By default Postfix also applies this to attached
#   emails but we turn this off by setting nested_header_checks empty.

# Prevent non-authenticated users from sending mail that requires being

# * `permit_mynetworks`: Mail that originates locally.

# ### DANE

# When connecting to remote SMTP servers, prefer TLS and use DANE if available.
#
# Prefering ("opportunistic") TLS means Postfix will use TLS if the remote end
# offers it, otherwise it will transmit the message in the clear. Postfix will
# accept whatever SSL certificate the remote end provides. Opportunistic TLS
# protects against passive easvesdropping (but not man-in-the-middle attacks).
# DANE takes this a step further:
#
# Postfix queries DNS for the TLSA record on the destination MX host. If no TLSA records are found,
# then opportunistic TLS is used. Otherwise the server certificate must match the TLSA records
# or else the mail bounces. TLSA also requires DNSSEC on the MX host. Postfix doesn't do DNSSEC
# itself but assumes the system's nameserver does and reports DNSSEC status. Thus this also
# relies on our local DNS server (see system.sh) and `smtp_dns_support_level=dnssec`.
#
# The `smtp_tls_CAfile` is superflous, but it eliminates warnings in the logs about untrusted certs,
# which we don't care about seeing because Postfix is doing opportunistic TLS anyway. Better to encrypt,
# even if we don't know if it's to the right party, than to not encrypt at all. Instead we'll
# now see notices about trusted certs. The CA file is provided by the package `ca-certificates`.

# ### Incoming Mail

# Pass any incoming mail over to a local delivery agent. Spamassassin
# will act as the LDA agent at first. It is listening on port 10025
# with LMTP. Spamassassin will pass the mail over to Dovecot after.
#
# In a basic setup we would pass mail directly to Dovecot by setting
# virtual_transport to `lmtp:unix:private/dovecot-lmtp`.
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf virtual_transport=lmtp:[127.0.0.1]:10025
# Because of a spampd bug, limit the number of recipients in each connection.
# See https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/issues/1523.
tools/editconf.py /etc/postfix/main.cf lmtp_destination_recipient_limit=1


# Who can send mail to us? Some basic filters.
#
# * `reject_non_fqdn_sender`: Reject not-nice-looking return paths.
# * `reject_unknown_sender_domain`: Reject return paths with invalid domains.
# * `reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch`: Reject if mail FROM address does not match the client SASL login
# * `reject_rhsbl_sender`: Reject return paths that use blacklisted domains.
# * `permit_sasl_authenticated`: Authenticated users (i.e. on port 587) can skip further checks.
# * `permit_mynetworks`: Mail that originates locally can skip further checks.
# * `reject_rbl_client`: Reject connections from IP addresses blacklisted in zen.spamhaus.org
# * `reject_unlisted_recipient`: Although Postfix will reject mail to unknown recipients, it's nicer to reject such mail ahead of greylisting rather than after.
# * `check_policy_service`: Apply greylisting using postgrey.
#
# Notes: #NODOC
# permit_dnswl_client can pass through mail from whitelisted IP addresses, which would be good to put before greylisting #NODOC
# so these IPs get mail delivered quickly. But when an IP is not listed in the permit_dnswl_client list (i.e. it is not #NODOC
# whitelisted) then postfix does a DEFER_IF_REJECT, which results in all "unknown user" sorts of messages turning into #NODOC
# "450 4.7.1 Client host rejected: Service unavailable". This is a retry code, so the mail doesn't properly bounce. #NODOC
